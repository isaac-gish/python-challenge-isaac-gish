Python Challenge (Challenge 3)

All code was written by me using VS code with the help of previous class modules 

Part 1 is contained in the file named Part1Test.py

Part 2 is contained in the file named Part2Test.py 

The code for the entire assignment is contained in main.py

There is a text file containing the results from part 1 and 2 separately, as well as a text file containing both results together.
